**Intro**

This paper contains both ChIP-seq and transcriptomics data for 7 Ap1 TFs in _C. glabrata_. It also contains results that contradicts that of the Kuo et al 2010. The main difference is that Kuo et al 2010 claims to discover a specificity shift (from YRE-O to YRE-A) for CgAp-1, while this paper claims no such shift.

**Goal**

Process the ChIP-seq data in order to identify Yap1 targets.
